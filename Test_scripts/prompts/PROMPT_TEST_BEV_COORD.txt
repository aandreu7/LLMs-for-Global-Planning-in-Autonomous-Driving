I am attaching an image showing the birds-eye-view of my surroundings.  

On the birds-eye-view, my position is indicated by a red arrow showing the direction my car is facing.  
My destination is marked with a blue square.

Additionally, you will receive numeric coordinates for the origin (current position of my car) and the destination, given as (x, y) in image pixel coordinates.

Your task is to determine the next action that I have to take with my car to reach the blue destination square, minimizing the driving distance.  
This is a classification task with three possible outputs: Right, Left, Straight.

Please respond with only one unique word (Straight/Right/Left).
