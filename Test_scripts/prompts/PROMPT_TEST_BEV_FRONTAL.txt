I am attaching two images:

1. An image showing the road where I am located.  
2. An image showing the birds-eye-view of my surroundings.

On the birds-eye-view, my position is indicated by a red arrow showing the direction my car is facing.  
My destination is marked with a blue square.

Your task is to determine the next action that I have to take with my car to reach the blue destination square, minimizing the driving distance.  
This is a classification task with three possible outputs: Right, Left, Straight.

Please respond with only one unique word (Straight/Right/Left).
